aerospace
systems is corrosion. For example, when
an aircraft lands and the door is opened,
the inside of the plane often fills with
warm moist air. When the plane takes
flight, and reaches altitude, the skin of the
aircraft becomes very cold due to the
temperature of the outside air. This causes
the moisture held by the air inside the
cabin to condense on the inside of the
aircraft skin. The water will collect at low
areas and serve as the electrolyte needed
for corrosion to occur.
